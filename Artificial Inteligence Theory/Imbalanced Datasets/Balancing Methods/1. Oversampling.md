# Introduction

Oversampling is the process of generating **more data** based on samples from the dataset in order to achieve a similar number of samples for all classes. 

> [!warning] 
> When duplicating or augmentig samples from the minority classes, the ML algorithm will tend to "learn" them by heart in order to achieve a low error rate, thus leading to #overfit.

## 1. Naive Random Oversampling

Randomly duplicate elements from the minor class (the classes with lesser samples) until all classes have the same number of elements.

```Python
from imblearn.over_sampling import RandomOverSampler

sampler = RandomOverSampler(random_state=42)
X_resampled, y_resampled = sampler.fit_resample(X, y)
```

## 2. SMOTE - Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique

SMOTE is a data augmentation technique that creates a "synthetic" sample based two randomly selected samples of the minority class.

```Python
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE

sampler = SMOTE()
X_resampled, y_resampled = sampler.fit_resample(X, y)
```

## 3. ADASYN - Adaptive Synthetic

ADASYN creates a "synthetic" sample based on two randomly selected samples of the minority class while **retaining the sample distribution**.

```Python
from imblearn.over_sampling import ADASYN

sampler = ADASYN()
X_resampled, y_resampled = sampler.fit_resample(X, y)
```

## 4. SMOTENC

SMOTENC is a variant of SMOTE which supports categorical features for samples.

```Python
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTENC

sampler = SMOTENC(categorical_features=[0, 2], random_state=42)
X_resampled, y_resampled = sampler.fit_resample(X, y)
```
