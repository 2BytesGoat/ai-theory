# Introduction

Undersampling is the process of **removing data** from the dataset in order to achieve a similar number of samples for all classes. 

>[!warning]
>When removing samples from the majority class, one may discard important data points which would have helped the ML algorithm get out of a #localMinimum.

## 1. Random Undersampler

Randomly remove elements from the minor class (the classes with lesser samples) until all classes have the same number of elements.

```Python
from imblearn.under_sampling import RandomUnderSampler

sampler = RandomUnderSampler(random_state=42)
X_resampled, y_resampled = sampler.fit_resample(X, y)
```

## 2. Cluster Centroids

Cluster Centroids works by applying the [[K-Means Clustering]] method over the majority class and removing the samples furthest from the resulting centroids.

```Python
from imblearn.under_sampling import ClusterCentroids

sampler = ClusterCentroids(random_state=0)
X_resampled, y_resampled = sampler.fit_resample(X, y)
```
